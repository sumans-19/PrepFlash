    question: "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    answer: "Learning types",
    explanation: "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is known, such as classification and regression tasks. Unsupervised learning involves training on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
    answer: "Model generalization issue",
    explanation: "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. It often indicates that the model is too complex for the amount of data available."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a confusion matrix?",
    answer: "Evaluate classification performance",
    explanation: "A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping to calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a neural network?",
    answer: "Biologically-inspired model",
    explanation: "A neural network is a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships in data. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), used particularly in deep learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is gradient descent?",
    answer: "Optimization algorithm",
    explanation: "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function to reach the minimum value."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between precision and recall?",
    answer: "Classification metrics",
    explanation: "Precision is the ratio of true positives to the total predicted positives, measuring accuracy among positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positives to actual positives, measuring how well the model finds all relevant instances."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of activation functions in neural networks?",
    answer: "Non-linear transformation",
    explanation: "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh. Without them, the network would behave like a linear model."
  },
  {
    question: "What is feature scaling and why is it important?",
    answer: "Normalize input features",
    explanation: "Feature scaling is the process of normalizing input features so they are on a similar scale, improving the performance and convergence speed of many ML algorithms, especially those that use distance metrics or gradient descent."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between classification and regression?",
    answer: "Output type",
    explanation: "Classification is the task of predicting a discrete label (e.g., spam or not spam), while regression is the task of predicting a continuous value (e.g., house price). Both are types of supervised learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is k-means clustering?",
    answer: "Unsupervised learning algorithm",
    explanation: "K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters, where each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It's used to discover underlying groupings in data."
